    CAEN Libs - Python binding

    Changelog.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


v3.1.0 (XX/XX/2025)
-------------------

Fixes:
- Fixed the data size returned by `blt_read_cycle` and `fifo_blt_read_cycle`.
    Note that the return type has also changed; see the following points for
    details.

Changes:
- To improve performance, some functions now return a `bytes` object instead
    of a `list[int]`: `blt_read_cycle` and `fifo_blt_read_cycle` on `caenvme`,
    and `blt_read` and `mblt_read` on `caencomm`. This is a breaking change:
    the library now returns a raw byte view, not repacked by data width. For
    `caenvme`, each value corresponds to the number of bytes specified by the
    data width. For `caencomm`, the data width is always `D32`, so each value
    corresponds to 4 bytes. This change also makes these functions consistent
    with `mblt_read_cycle` and `fifo_mblt_read_cycle` on `caenvme`. Note also
    that return size of these two functions was broken in previous versions.
- For the same reason, two functions on `caenvme` (`blt_write_cycle` and
    `fifo_blt_write_cycle`) now takes a `bytes` object as argument instead of
    a `Sequence[int]`. Also this is a breaking change.


v3.0.1 (30/10/2025)
-------------------

Fixes:
- Fix decode of `X742Event` and `X743Event` on `caendigitizer`.
- Fix return type of `caenhvwrapper.Device.get_ch_name` in case of empty
    channel list.


v3.0.0 (08/10/2025)
-------------------

New features:
- Support for CAEN Digitizer as `caendigitizer` (requires Python 3.10+).
- Add `slot` field to `caenhvwrapper.Board` to get the slot directly from
    the object returned by `caenhvwrapper.Device.get_crate_map` and
    `caenhvwrapper.Device.test_bd_presence`.

Fixes:
- Fix error check in functions using `caenhvwrapper.lib.init_system`, i.e.
    `caenhvwrapper.Device.open` and `caenhvwrapper.Device.connect`.
- Fix `caencomm.vme_iack_cycle16` and `caencomm.vme_iack_cycle32`.

Changes:
- On `caenhvwrapper.EventData`, `board_index` and `channel_index` fields has
    been renamed respectively `slot` and `channel`, and now their value is an
    `Optional[int]`, and is set to None if the value of the underlying library
    is -1. Old fields are kept as class property for backward compatibility.
- Remove deprecated `ErrorCode` alias to `Error.Code` from all modules.
- Change channel index hierarchy in `caendpplib` classes `PHAParams` and
    `DgtzParams`: now channel-related parameters are stored in an internal
    object `ch` that can be iterated. `DgtzParams.coinc_params` kept outside
    channel object because it has an additional slot for external channel,
    so it is always initialized to `MAX_NUMCHB_COINCIDENCE` elements.


v2.2.0 (03/07/2025)
-------------------

New features:
- Add some functions missing on `caenplu.Device`: `write_data32`,
    `write_fifo32`, `read_data32`, `read_fifo32`, `connection_status` and
    functions related to gate and delay generators.

Fixes:
- Fix regression on `caenvme.Device.read_display` on Linux, introduced on
    v2.0.0.


v2.1.0 (13/05/2025)
-------------------

New features:
- Enhanced `caenhvwrapper` event handling with customizable TCP port ranges
    through two new class methods: `Device.set_events_tcp_ports()` and
    `Device.get_events_tcp_ports()`. Users can now specify the upper port
    limit, with default behavior changed from fixed range [10001, 65536) to
    [0, 1), allowing the operating system to automatically select ports when
    no specific range is required for firewall configuration. The environmental
    variable `HV_FIRST_BIND_PORT` is now deprecated in favor of this more
    flexible approach. The selected port can be accessed with a new property
    `Device.events_tcp_port`.
- Add new values of `caendpplib.ConnectionType`, introduced on CAENDPPLib
     v1.16.0.

Fixes:
- Fixed support for events on R6060, regression introduced in v2.0.0.
- Fix possible undefined behavior on `caenhvwrapper.Device.get_sys_prop`.
- Fixed ABI compatibility issue in `caendpplib.Device.add_board` that was
    functioning correctly on Windows by coincidence but failed on Linux
    platforms.

Changes:
- Renamed default filenames and run names in `caendpplib` to more clearly
    indicate their origin from the Python binding.


v2.0.2 (18/03/2025)
-------------------

Fixes:
- Fixed regression in `caenhvwrapper.Device.subscribe_*_params` introduced in
    v2.0.0 affecting all modules except R6060. The issue caused subscription
    failures on systems where `socket.has_dualstack_ipv6()` returns True.

Changes:
- Changed default log directory for `caendpplib` on Windows from
    `%APPDATA%\CAEN` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CAEN`.


v2.0.1 (12/02/2025)
-------------------

Fixes:
- Fix README and docstring in `caendpplib` demo.


v2.0.0 (12/02/2025)
-------------------

New features:
- Support for CAEN DPP Library as `caendpplib`. NumPy added as dependency
    being required by this new submodule.
- Improved `caenvme` demo.

Changes:
- Removed `caenhvwrapper.lib.get_error`, useless at library class level
    because requires an handle as argument. The underlying function is still
    called automatically on error constructor, if appropriate.
- Removed `caenvme.DataWidth.ctypes`.

Fixes:
- Properly close event sockets on `caenhvwrapper.Device.close`.
- Improved `subscribe_*_params`/`unsubscribe_*_params` error messages
    on `caenhvwrapper`.
- Force ASCII encode/decode of strings, being the only encoding supported
    by the underlying C libraries.
- Fix `caenplu.lib.usb_enumerate`.
- `caenplu.BoardInfo` and `caenplu.USBDevice` were inheriting from
    `ctypes.Structure` by mistake.


v1.3.0 (02/12/2024)
-------------------

New features:
- Dropped support for Python 3.8.
- `Device` classes of all modules has `__slots__` on Python >= 3.10,
    except `caenhvwrapper` that has this feature only on Python >= 3.11.

Fixes:
- Fix `multi_write`, `get_input_conf` and `get_output_conf` on `caenvme`.


v1.2.0 (18/11/2024)
-------------------

New features:
- Improved register class, introduced in v1.1.0, with functions to
    directly call get/set/multi_get/multi_set without `__getitem__`
    and `__setitem__`.
- Introduced a new base class `error.BaseError` for handling errors
    across submodules.
- Support for 32-bit PID introduced with CAEN HV Wrapper 7.0.

Fixes:
- Add missing binding of `CAENVME_GetFIFOMode` from `caenvme`.
- Fix Python < 3.12 `caenhvwrapper` support (thanks to @sergey-ryzhikov)

Changes:
- Submodule-specific `ErrorCode` classes have been renamed to `Error.Code`
    for consistency.
- The old `ErrorCode` names are now deprecated and will be removed in a
    future version.


v1.1.0 (19/09/2024)
-------------------

New features:
- Support for Resol parameter property on caenhvwrapper for VME8100.
- Support for 32-bit PID on CAENComm demo.
- New way to access registers by using `__getitem__` and `__setitem__`.
    This enables also read-modify-write operations in a single line
    of code,using in-place operators like `dev.reg32[0x40] &= 0xFF`.
    It has been added in `caenvme` (registers), `caencomm` (reg16 and
    reg32) and `caenplu` (registers). Slicing is supported.

Fixes:
- Fix `caenhvwrapper` load on Linux.
- Classes inheriting `enum.Flag` now inherit enum.IntFlag to improve
    the support of unknown flags. This applies to `caenvme.IRQLevels`,
    `caencomm.IRQLevels` and all the classes on `caenhvwrapperflags`.
- Fix decode of `caenhvwrapper.ParamProp.enum.`
- Fix error detection on `caenhvwrapper.Device.get_XX_param_prop()`

Changes:
- Removed opened member from device class.


v1.0.3 (02/07/2024)
-------------------

New features:
- Better support of `caenhvwrapper` error messages.

Fixes:
- Fix `caenhvwrapper.exec_comm`.
- Fix support of non PARAMETER events on `caenhvwrapper` (regression
    introduced on v1.0.1).


v1.0.2 (26/05/2024)
-------------------

Fixes:
- Readme updated.


v1.0.1 (25/06/2024)
-------------------

Changes:
- On `caenhvwrapper` and `caenplu` some functions now return tuples instead of
    lists.
- Examples moved to examples folder.
- Renamed some (unused) values on `caenvme.AddressModifiers`.

New features:
- Update `[project.urls]` on pyproject.tolm, with new public repositories
    on github.com.

Fixes:
- Fix some typos.


v1.0.0 (21/06/2024)
-------------------

First public release.
